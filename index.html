            <h2><a href="https://github.com/kifferltd/open-mika/"></a>Open Mika</a></h2>
      <p><strong>Open Mi<em>k</em>a</strong> is an open-source Java runtime dedicated to supporting the OSGi RFC 26 Foundation Execution Environment. It is characterised by a small footprint both in terms of the executable size of the runtime itself (&lt;2MB for both VM and class libraries, in the &ldquo;headless&rdquo; version) and in terms of the external libraries used (libc and on Linux libpthread). The BSD-style licence is equally lightweight in the obligations it places on the redistributor; the source code may be modified or extra libraries may be linked in without the obligation to provide source code to end users.</p>
      <p>Because of the deliberate restriction to  OSGi RFC 26, currently Mika does not support Java 5 language features such as generics. A version with Java 5 support is in preparation, but initially this will only be available as part of the <strong>Mi<em>k</em>a Ma<em>x</em></strong> product. Support is provided for JNI on Linux and on those uClinux targets which support the use of shared libraries.</p>
      <p>A number of features can be selected at the time of building Mika: by omitting unneeded features a smaller (and in some cases faster) Mika binary can be created.</p>
      <dl><dt>AWT options </dt><dd> 
      <ul>
      <li>None - no AWT is provided. </li>
      <li>Framebuffer - writes directly to the Linux framebuffer device </li>
      <li>X11 - opens an X11 frame and uses it as a &ldquo;virtual framebuffer&rdquo;         (primarily intended for development purposes). </li>
      </ul>
      </dd><dt>Jarfile verification options </dt><dd> 
      <ul>
      <li>None - no verification is performed. </li>
      <li>Java - Jarfile verification is performed in Java code. </li>
      <li>Native - Jarfile verification is performed in Native code         (not yet available). </li>
      </ul>
      </dd><dt>Bytecode options </dt><dd> 
      <ul>
      <li>False - no verification is performed. </li>
      <li>True - Bytecode verification is performed. </li>
      </ul>
      </dd><dt>Security options </dt><dd> 
      <ul>
      <li>None - no security checks are performed. </li>
      <li>Coarse - security checks are performed by invoking a user-supplied         security manager. </li>
      <li>Fine - security checks are performed by directly invoking the          built-in AccessController. </li>
      </ul>
      </dd><dt>Optional libraries </dt><dd> 
      <ul>
      <li><code>java.beans</code> - a minimal implementation suitable for use     on an embedded client machine. For a full implementation it is better     to adopt code from another project such as Apache Harmony. </li>
      <li><code>javax.comm</code> - an implementation for Linux/uClinux,     covering serial ports only (no parallel port support). </li>
      </ul>
      </dd></dl>
      <h3>Supported platforms</h3>
      <p>The standard Mika codebase can be compiled and run directly on the following platforms, using a suitable gcc-based cross-compiler:</p>
      <dl><dd> 
      <ul>
      <li>CPU architectures: ARM (arm7tdmi, arm9, xscale; ...), MIPS (e.g. bcm63xx), PowerPC, x86 (32-bit mode only).</li>
      <li>Operating Systems: Linux, uClinux.</li>
      </ul>
      </dd></dl>
      <p>Porting to other 32-bit CPU architectures and operating systems is certainly possible, but you would be well advised to contact <span style="color:red">KIFFER</span> for support.</p>
      <h3>License</h3>
      <p>The<strong> Mi<em>k</em>a</strong>-specific source code is covered by a BSD-style license, which allows modified versions to be distributed without an obligation to supply source code. Some classes are derived from the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/">GNU Classpath</a> project, and these are covered by the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/license.html">Classpath &ldquo;GPL with linking exception&rdquo; license</a>. Other classes are derived from the <a href="http://harmony.apache.org/">Apache Harmony</a> project and are covered by <a href="http://harmony.apache.org/license.html">ASL 2.0</a>.</p>
      <p>Our aim is that <strong>Mi<em>k</em>a</strong> can safely be linked with native code libraries without endangering confidential or proprietary information that these may contain. To this end we are in the process of removing dependencies on GNU Classpath, because some customers are unhappy with the way the license is worded. On the other hand our use of Apache Harmony code is likely to increase, as this poses no licensing problems and the codebase is subjected to intensive use and testing.  See the  <a href="/mika/trac/">open-source Mika developers' site</a> for more details.</p>
